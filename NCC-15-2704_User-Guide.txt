## What is Drupal? CMS Essentials [section-whatisdrupal]
North Central College’s website is built with a content management system – or CMS – called Drupal.
 
CMSs like Drupal make it possible for people without technical skills to create and edit pages, news articles, events and other content.
 
If you’ve edited pages on North Central’s old site or used blogging platforms like Wordpress, you’ve used a CMS before. In fact, North Central’s previous site was built with an earlier version of Drupal.

Drupal is an open source product. A strong, dedicated community of developers from around the world contributes the code that makes Drupal run. There’s no cost to use it, and it is the platform of choice for organizations ranging from The Economist to The City of Austin to Cisco to other colleges and universities.  

---   

### Key Concepts  

---   

#### Content Types
Often, when we’re on websites, everything seems like it’s just a page. But in Drupal, there are many different things that create a site. They’re called “content types.”

Content types are like containers that hold elements together.
 
For example, the elements of an article include a title, an image, a subtitle and body copy.

![Content Types](assets/content_type.png)
North Central’s site includes custom content types like program created for the College’s academic degrees.
  
> **TIP**  
> To see all content types that you have access to create, go to Content > Add Content

---   

#### Nodes
Every piece of content on the site (a page, a video, a program, etc.) is called a node. When you’re editing the site, you’ll see the unique node ID in the browser’s URL bar. Something like this:

> *http://northcentralcollege.edu/node/116/edit*

Site visitors never see this unique ID. Instead, they see standard URLs like:

> *http://northcentralcollege.edu/how-to-apply*  

---   

#### Templates
Templates pull all the elements of a content type into a visual look. They’re what visitors see when they come to the site. North Central templates are designed to be highly flexible.  


---

## Components: The Site's Visual Building Blocks[section-components]

Components are the visual building blocks of the site’s templates. When you create content (e.g. page, program), you are given a variety of components to use. The available components and the way you can arrange them have been carefully thought out to balance flexibility with visual consistency across the site.

The site uses the components listed below most frequently. They are the most important to be familiar with, especially if you manage pages:    

---   

#### Cards
![Sample of Card Types](assets/cards.png)
Cards are interactive blocks that highlight key pieces of information. For example, a profile card features a person’s name, title and their photo. Most cards are intended to guide users to additional information or to take an action. When a user clicks on an event card, for instance, it will take them to the full details of the event. 

![Article Card](assets/card_article.png)
##### Article
These are auto-generated by the site to show the basic details of a news article.

![Call to Action Card](assets/card_cta.png)
##### Call to Action
Draw attention and guide users to other content with this card. Text on a call-to-action card should include descriptive or “marketing-style” language rather than just the name of where clicking the card will take the user.

![Call to Action Card with Image](assets/card_cta_photo.png)
##### Call to Action with Image
Similar to the call-to-action card but includes an image.

![Career Card](assets/card_career.png)
##### Career
Use within the program content type to feature a profession that graduates of that program might enter. Include a short description or interesting fact.

![Event Card](assets/card_event.png)
##### Event
These are auto-generated by the site to show the basic details of an event. 

![Facebook Card](http://placehold.it/1280x800)
##### Facebook
A post from a North Central Facebook account. These appear in social stacks.

![Factoid Card](assets/card_factoid.png)
##### Factoid
Use this card to highlight a key fact about the College, a program or another topic relevant to where you’re placing the factoid card.

![Feature Card](assets/card_feature.png)
##### Feature
Use the feature card to promote a story or article with “evergreen” appeal. Examples are stories about an alum or a student that aren’t time-sensitive.

![Gallery Card](assets/card_gallery.png)
##### Gallery
Opens a gallery of photos. 

![Instagram Card](http://placehold.it/1280x800)
##### Instagram
A post from a North Central Instagram account. These appear in social stacks.

![Image Card](assets/card_image.png)
##### Image
Image cards are good for giving visual relief to stacks with several text-based cards. They feature an image and do not link anywhere.

![Map Card](http://placehold.it/1280x800)
##### Map
Shows the location of an event in a Google map.

![Profile Full Card](http://placehold.it/1280x800)
##### Profile - Full
An image and title of a member of North Central that links to the person’s profile. Typically used to highlight faculty or staff.

![Profile Story Card](http://placehold.it/1280x800)
##### Profile - Story
An image and major or tile of a member of North Central that opens a prose-style profile (e.g. student story). These are typically used to highlight students.

![Program Card](assets/card_program.png)
##### Program
These are mostly auto-generated in places like the program finder to provide a short description of an academic or experiential program that appeals to prospective students.

![Quotes Card](assets/card_quote.png)
##### Quote
A brief quote by a student, professor, or other College community member.

![Title Card](assets/card_title.png)
##### Title
A brief, catchy statement or interesting sentence, similar to a headline or pull quote meant to draw user’s attention but not lead them to click through to other content. The title card doesn’t include a link.

![Twitter Card](http://placehold.it/1280x800)
##### Twitter
A tweet from a North Central Twitter account. These appear in social stacks.

![Video Card](assets/card_video.png)
##### Video
Use this to embed a video in a stack.

---   

#### Stacks  
![Sample of Card Types](assets/stacks.png)
Stacks are groupings of cards that open and close as a user interacts with them. If a user is on a desktop computer, for example, the stack will animate when the user clicks a card in the stack. If they are on a smartphone or tablet the stack will animate when they touch a card. 

There are several types of stacks. For example, group, program and highlight. Each includes different types of cards. We’ve selected which stack types to use on each content type. All you need to do is choose places where you want to use stacks and the cards and content that will be included.

> **TIPS**  
> If there’s important information you want users to see in a stack, set the card that contains that information to be a featured card.
> Use a variety of card types when creating a stack.  
> By design, most stack types allow for five cards. While there isn’t a minimum required, aim for at least 3 cards.

---   

#### Teasers  
![Sampling of Teasers](assets/teasers.png)
Teasers are groupings of design elements that typically include an image or video, title, subtitle and text. Some also include a call-to-action button. 

There are several types of teasers and you can use them in a variety of combinations. For example, a feature teaser above 4 teaser blocks.

> **TIP**
> Use teasers to organize page content into easy to scan areas rather than walls of text.  

![Intro Teaser](assets/teaser_intro.png)
##### Intro Teaser
Includes a title, subtitle, and area for intro text. CTA buttons can be included as well. Use for introducing a page or section on a page. Combines well with the rich text component.

![Feature Teaser](assets/teaser_feature2.png)
##### Feature Teaser
Includes a title, subtitle, area for text, and spot for media (image, video or gallery). CTA buttons can be included as well. Works well as a stand-alone feature on a page to highlight a topic with media.

![Teasers Block](assets/teaser_block.png)
##### Teasers Block
Allows for up to 4 blocks that each include a title, short description, image and image. Use it to summarize a topic and lead users to more information with the CTA. 

---   
#### Calls to Action / CTAs
Call-to-actions are available throughout the site in a similar way as buttons on the current North Central site.

There are two types:
> CTA buttons on headers and teasers
> CTA cards

> **TIPS**
> Use CTAs for the most important thing you want users to do next or learn more about.
> CTAs should guide users to tasks or information in context of the content they appear. For example, on a program page Apply would be a likely action users would want to take.
> Do not overuse CTAs on a page or other content. If there are too many, they won't do their job of standing out.

---

#### Rich Text 
![Rich Text](assets/rich_text_front.png)
Rich text is useful when you need to present longer passages of text. It could also be described as “body copy.” The rich text component allows formatting such as heading styles to give your text hierarchy, making it easier for readers to follow. Bulleted lists, italics and bolding are also available. You can also create links to other pages (a.k.a. crosslinks), external sites or documents like PDFs uploaded to a page.

> **TIPS**
> Use heading styles to structure your text. See below for reasons why and how to. 
> Be purposeful in using formatting tools such as bold and italics. They should add meaning rather than decoration.

##### Heading Styles
![annotated image of page with heading styles](assets/rich_text_header.png)
When entering content into the rich text component you need to use heading styles to format headings and subheadings for sections and paragraphs. Heading styles adjust the font of headings and subheadings automatically so they are consistent throughout the site. 

IMPORTANT: Do not use bold for headings and subheadings. Only use bold for emphasizing words or phrases in a sentence.

Headings are necessary because they: 

> Give hierarchical structure and order to your information, making it more useful to users.
> Are essential for accessibility; visitors using a screen reader need headings to understand the order of information.
> Are important for SEO (search engine optimization). 

##### How to Add Headings
1. Highlight the text you want to make a heading.
2. Click the Format button and select the heading style you want to use. Note: The title of the page is a Heading 1 so you will want to use a Heading 2, 3 or 4 depending on if there is an intro teaser or other heading in another component already on the page. Be consistent with your heading styles across pages in a section of the site or tabs on content types like programs and departments.

---
#### Tables
![table example](assets/table.png)
The table component is for adding tabular data to a page. Please note that the table should only be used for numerical-type information and not for organizing paragraphs. In other words, use tables for structured information that is primarily numbers; do not use it for primarily prose that could be presented with normal text.

> **EXAMPLES**
> Do: use a table to show the tuition for degree programs for the upcoming academic year.
> Don’t: use tables to list descriptions of different types of programs or organizations. 

##### How to Add a Table
It’s a good idea to put your table in context with a title and any explanatory copy that will help users understand it. You can do that with the rich text component or an intro teaser. Once you have added that text with the rich text or intro teaser:

1. Choose Table from the dropdown for the Add to Section.
2. Enter the number of rows and columns you’ll need. You can adjust this if you need to.
3. Enter the data into the table.

> **TIPS**
> Use the rich text component (or an intro teaser) for any explanatory copy related to the table. 
> If you use column headers, make sure to have them on each column so the table displays properly on mobile.
> Don't use footnotes in the table or descriptive copy about the data. That info should be in the rich text or other component.

---   

#### Billboards
Billboards are built into the top area of certain content types, such as pages and events. So unlike other components, you won’t need to add billboards manually. Billboards typically display a header image, page title and call-to-action buttons. 

![General Billboard](assets/billboard_general.png)

![Media Billboard](assets/billboard_media.png)

--- 

#### Slider
The slider component is reserved for the homepage and subsite templates. You can use it to create “slides” of featured news and other content.
![Slider](assets/slider.png)
> **TIP**
> To increase the chance that a user will see a particular piece of content, put it as the first slide. Not all users will scroll through the slides, so important information should not be placed in slides 2, 3, etc.

---

## Image Specifications [section-imagespecs]

---

Minimal preparation is required when uploading images. For example, cropping is not necessary. 

The site will automatically crop the image to fit the design and the screen size the user is visiting the site on. To ensure that auto cropping doesn’t cut off an important part of an image, you can select a focal point when uploading the image. The focal point won’t be cut off it an image needs to be cropped for viewing on smaller screens.

![Image thumbnail with focal point (white crosshair).](assets/focal_point.png)

While you do not need to crop images before uploading, you should follow these size and aspect ratio guides.  

---   

#### Header Image & Slider  
Header images are part of the billboard component. They appear at the top of certain content types. The slider is used on the homepage and subsites only. 

*Recommended Image Size:* **3840 px x 2160 px**  
*Recommended Image Ratio:* **16:9**  
![General Billboard](assets/billboard_general.png "General Billboard")  

---   

#### Image Cards  
These specifications cover image use in all cards that require a background image. Please note that the styles shown depict best case assets and it’s recommended to follow these when making your image selections.  

*Recommended Image Size:* **1800 px x 1000 px**  
*Recommended Image Ratio:* **16:9**  

![(From left to right, top to bottom) Call to Action, Profile, Feature, Story, Image, Gallery and Video Cards](assets/cards.png "(From left to right, top to bottom) Call to Action, Profile, Feature, Story, Image, Gallery and Video Cards")

---   

#### Graphic Cards  
Graphic cards are cards that include icons/graphics, e.g. Call to Action and Factoid. Graphics can be any width and will be automatically sized to fit but a general height of around 300px is best.  

*Recommended Image Size:* **any px x 600 px**

![Call to Action and Factoid Card](assets/cards_graphic.png "Call to Action and Factoid Cards")

---   

#### Teasers  
These are the specs for all teaser types: feature, intro, blocks.

*Recommended Image Size:* **1800 px x 1000 px**  
*Recommended Image Ratio:* **16:9**  

![Smart teaser with three blocks.](assets/teaser_smart.png "Smart teaser with three blocks.")

![Feature Teaser](assets/teaser_feature.png "Feature Teaser")  

---   

#### General Images  
When using an image on its own (i.e. not in a teaser or card) on a page or other content type, follow these specifications. Note that images can be entered as full-width, full-width with parallax effect or content width.  

*Recommended Image Size:* **3840 px x 2160 px**  
*Recommended Image Ratio:* **16:9**  

![Full-width and content-width images.](assets/images.png "Full-width and content-width images.")

##### About Parallax Effect
With parallax, images are arranged in the background, with section content overlaying it so content moves on top of the image as the user scrolls. To use this effect, set layout to “full” when adding your image.

---

## Word Counts [section-wordounts]
Most components have a recommended word count to ensure that text fits properly. 

---

---

### Rich Text / Body Copy
There isn’t a limit to the number of words you can use for rich text or other text that would be considered “body copy” for things like bios, articles, etc.

However, keep in mind that online readers scan more than read. This means that breaking text into chunks with headings will greatly help your audience find relevant information. Also, keep sentences short (20 to 25 words) and don’t be afraid to use single-sentence paragraphs. Newspapers are filled with them.

---

## Logging Into the Site [section-login]
To manage content, including your profile, go to http://northcentralcollege.edu/user and log in with your North Central network account. This is the same username and password you use for your email, e.g., username@noctrl.edu.

---

## Creating and Editing Content [section-createandedit]
The types of content and specific pages you have access to create and edit on the site is determined by things like your role — staff or faculty, for example — and how much writing and editing for the site is part of your job responsibilities. 

### Workbench
If you have access to edit or create content on the site you will see an area called Workbench when you log in. This is where you will go to do any content-related activities on the site. For example, find content you created and want to edit or create new content.

The Workbench menu contains different items depending on a person’s role. For example, members of the marketing department will see different items than other departments.

### Review and Publishing
There is an editorial review process that determines which content can be published immediately when you create or edit it, and which content that the Office of Marketing and Communications will review and either publish or return for edits. In the saving options, if you see the option to Save and Publish, your content will be published without review.

### Content Requests and Guidance

##### Selecting the Form Template
In the form tab begin entering the name of the form you want to use. 

#### Build a Custom Form Template 
The site uses the YAML webform module which comes with template-style forms for a variety of common form types, e.g., registration. These templates can be used as a starting point to create custom forms. If you need to create a custom form and have access to the Structure > YAML Forms section of the CMS, follow the instructions below. If you do not have access to that section, contact a site administrator.

To customize a form:

1. Go to Structure or Shortcut > YAML form
2. Find the form template you want to use as a base and select Duplicate from the edit options.
3. Give the new form a title and description.
4. Customize the form by editing or deleting fields and adding new elements/fields.
5. Click Save elements to save the form. The form will now be available when using the Webform content type.

> **TIPS** 
> To edit the confirmation message people see when they submit a form (a recommended step), go to the Settings tab of the form and edit the text in the confirmation settings box.  
> To see the types of fields/elements you can use, view the example forms.
> The module supports emailing people who submit a form and other more advanced functionality. Learn more about [YAML form features] (http://yamlform.io/features/).

### Event Management [section-eventmanagement]

The site uses the RNG module for managing event registration. [Learn more about the module] (https://www.drupal.org/project/rng) 

---  

### Taxonomies [section-taxonomies]
Taxonomies are used to manage things like the categories that programs can be filed under and that appear in the program finder. They are also used to manage categories for other types of content, such as articles and event types.

Taxonomies are also used to manage who can edit certain content on the site. The editorial sections taxonomy is one example.

To manage taxonomies, go to Structure > Taxonomy

> **TIP** 
> If you want change the name of a term that is already used to categorize content, edit the term rather than delete and add a new term. This way you don’t have to retag the content with the updated term name.

---  

### Editorial Access and Workflows [section-editorialaccess]
To control specific content (e.g. a particular page or program) a CMS user can edit, the site uses a module called Workbench and taxonomies. 

The primary taxonomy that’s used to manage editing access to content is the Editorial Sections taxonomy. That taxonomy allows for the creation of groups such as Marketing or Admissions. CMS users are assigned to the various editorial sections created.

Certain content, such as pages, includes an editorial sections tab. In that tab you can select an editorial section. Users who are part of that editorial section can then edit the content, even if they did not originally create it. 

An example:
The undergraduate academics page is tagged with the Marketing and Communications editorial section. Jane is a member of the Marketing and Communications editorial section. Jane can edit the undergraduate academics page even though she isn’t the original author.

To manage the editorial section taxonomy, go to Structure > Taxonomy

To manage Workbench, go to Configuration > Workflow

#### Workbench
The [Workbench] (https://www.drupal.org/node/2121239) module manages publishing workflows and revisions. 

Workbench can be configured to suit North Central’s editorial needs. Some examples:
> When an admin creates a new page they can save and publish it immediately
> When an editor creates a page and saves it, it is saved as a draft for review by an author who publishes it 
> When an editor wants to edit an existing page they create a new draft, save it, and an author publishes it or sends it back as a draft

To configure Workbench settings, go to Configuration > Workflow

---   

### Roles and Permissions [section-rolesandpermissions]

To control actions CMS users can take and the parts of the CMS they have access to, the site uses roles and permissions. 

A “role” is a type of user, e.g., administrator, author, editor. A “permission” is a task that can be completed, e.g., publish a program, delete a page. 

Users are allowed to perform tasks based on the role they are assigned. Roles can be assigned manually by administrators and automatically through the North Central College data source used to authenticate users. Roles and permissions can be expanded and modified as needed. 

To manage roles, go to People > Roles

To manage permissions, go to People > Permissions

### Meta Tags/SEO [section-metatags]
To include information like page descriptions that search engines use to match users’ search queries with web content, the site uses the Meta Tags module.

You can also manage what’s shown when site content is shared on social networks like Facebook using the Meta Tags module.

The Meta Tags module includes many more ways to optimize content for search engines and social networks. Learn more about the [Meta Tags module] (https://www.drupal.org/project/metatag).
