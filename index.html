<h2 id="section-whatisdrupal">What is Drupal? CMS Essentials</h2>

<p>North Central College’s website is built with a content management system – or CMS – called Drupal.</p>

<p>CMSs like Drupal make it possible for people without technical skills to create and edit pages, news articles, events and other content.</p>

<p>If you’ve edited pages on North Central’s old site or used blogging platforms like Wordpress, you’ve used a CMS before. In fact, North Central’s previous site was built with an earlier version of Drupal.</p>

<p>Drupal is an open source product. A strong, dedicated community of developers from around the world contributes the code that makes Drupal run. There’s no cost to use it, and it is the platform of choice for organizations ranging from The Economist to The City of Austin to Cisco to other colleges and universities. </p>

<hr />

<h3>Key Concepts</h3>

<hr />

<h4>Content Types</h4>

<p>Often, when we’re on websites, everything seems like it’s just a page. But in Drupal, there are many different things that create a site. They’re called “content types.”</p>

<p>Content types are like containers that hold elements together.</p>

<p>For example, the elements of an article include a title, an image, a subtitle and body copy.</p>

<p><img src="assets/content_type.png" alt="Content Types" />
North Central’s site includes custom content types like program created for the College’s academic degrees.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>TIP</strong><br/>
To see all content types that you have access to create, go to Content &gt; Add Content</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h4>Nodes</h4>

<p>Every piece of content on the site (a page, a video, a program, etc.) is called a node. When you’re editing the site, you’ll see the unique node ID in the browser’s URL bar. Something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>http://northcentralcollege.edu/node/116/edit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Site visitors never see this unique ID. Instead, they see standard URLs like:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>http://northcentralcollege.edu/how-to-apply</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h4>Templates</h4>

<p>Templates pull all the elements of a content type into a visual look. They’re what visitors see when they come to the site. North Central templates are designed to be highly flexible. </p>

<hr />

<h2 id="section-components">Components: The Site&#8217;s Visual Building Blocks</h2>

<p>Components are the visual building blocks of the site’s templates. When you create content (e.g. page, program), you are given a variety of components to use. The available components and the way you can arrange them have been carefully thought out to balance flexibility with visual consistency across the site.</p>

<p>The site uses the components listed below most frequently. They are the most important to be familiar with, especially if you manage pages: </p>

<hr />

<h4>Cards</h4>

<p><img src="assets/cards.png" alt="Sample of Card Types" />
Cards are interactive blocks that highlight key pieces of information. For example, a profile card features a person’s name, title and their photo. Most cards are intended to guide users to additional information or to take an action. When a user clicks on an event card, for instance, it will take them to the full details of the event. </p>

<hr />

<h4>Stacks</h4>

<p><img src="assets/stacks.png" alt="Sample of Card Types" />
Stacks are groupings of cards that open and close as a user interacts with them. If a user is on a desktop computer, for example, the stack will animate when the user clicks a card in the stack. If they are on a smartphone or tablet the stack will animate when they touch a card. </p>

<p>There are several types of stacks. For example, group, program and highlight. Each includes different types of cards. We’ve selected which stack types to use on each content type. All you need to do is choose places where you want to use stacks and the cards and content that will be included.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>TIPS</strong><br/>
If there’s important information you want users to see in a stack, set the card that contains that information to be a featured card.
Use a variety of card types when creating a stack.<br/>
By design, most stack types allow for five cards. While there isn’t a minimum required, aim for at least 3 cards.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h4>Teasers</h4>

<p><img src="assets/teasers.png" alt="Sampling of Teasers" />
Teasers are groupings of design elements that typically include an image or video, title, subtitle and text. Some also include a call-to-action button. </p>

<p>There are several types of teasers and you can use them in a variety of combinations. For example, a feature teaser above 4 teaser blocks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>TIP</strong>
Use teasers to organize page content into easy to scan areas rather than walls of text. </p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h4>Rich Text</h4>

<p><img src="file:///Users/Jason/Desktop/rich_text_front.png" alt="Rich Text" />
Rich text is useful when you need to present longer passages of text. It could also be described as “body copy.” The rich text component allows formatting such as heading styles to give your text hierarchy, making it easier for readers to follow. Bulleted lists, italics and bolding are also available. You can also create links to other pages (a.k.a. crosslinks), external sites or documents like PDFs uploaded to a page.
<img src="assets/rich_text.png" alt="Editor view of rich text wysiwyg editor and front end view." /></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>TIPS</strong>
Use heading styles in an orderly way. For example, Heading 2 for all headings that hierarchically fall at the same level, then Heading 3 for subheadings that might go under Heading 2 sections.
Be purposeful in using formatting tools such as bold. They should add meaning rather than decoration.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h4>Billboards</h4>

<p>Billboards are built into the top area of certain content types, such as pages and events. So unlike other components, you won’t need to add billboards manually. Billboards typically display a header image, page title and call-to-action buttons. </p>

<figure>
<img src="assets/billboard_general.png" alt="General Billboard" />
<figcaption>General Billboard</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<img src="assets/billboard_media.png" alt="Media Billboard" />
<figcaption>Media Billboard</figcaption>
</figure>

<hr />

<h4>Slider</h4>

<p>The slider component is reserved for the homepage and subsite templates. You can use it to create “slides” of featured news and other content.
<img src="assets/slider.png" alt="Slider" /></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>TIP</strong>
To increase the chance that a user will see a particular piece of content, put it as the first slide. Not all users will scroll through the slides, so important information should not be placed in slides 2, 3, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2 id="section-imagespecs">Image Specifications</h2>

<hr />

<p>Minimal preparation is required when uploading images. For example, cropping is not necessary. </p>

<p>The site will automatically crop the image to fit the design and the screen size the user is visiting the site on. To ensure that auto cropping doesn’t cut off an important part of an image, you can select a focal point when uploading the image. The focal point won’t be cut off it an image needs to be cropped for viewing on smaller screens.</p>

<figure>
<img src="assets/focal_point.png" alt="Image thumbnail with focal point (white crosshair)." />
<figcaption>Image thumbnail with focal point (white crosshair).</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>While you do not need to crop images before uploading, you should follow these size and aspect ratio guides. </p>

<hr />

<h4>Header Image &amp; Slider</h4>

<p>Header images are part of the billboard component. They appear at the top of certain content types. The slider is used on the homepage and subsites only. </p>

<p><em>Recommended Image Size:</em> <strong>3840 px x 2160 px</strong><br/>
<em>Recommended Image Ratio:</em> <strong>16:9</strong><br/>
<img src="assets/billboard_general.png" alt="General Billboard" title="General Billboard" /> </p>

<hr />

<h4>Image Cards</h4>

<p>These specifications cover image use in all cards that require a background image. Please note that the styles shown depict best case assets and it’s recommended to follow these when making your image selections. </p>

<p><em>Recommended Image Size:</em> <strong>1800 px x 1000 px</strong><br/>
<em>Recommended Image Ratio:</em> <strong>16:9</strong> </p>

<figure>

<figcaption>(From left to right, top to bottom) Call to Action, Profile, Feature, Story, Image, Gallery and Video Cards</figcaption>
</figure>

<hr />

<h4>Graphic Cards</h4>

<p>Graphic cards are cards that include icons/graphics, e.g. Call to Action and Factoid. Graphics can be any width and will be automatically sized to fit but a general height of around 300px is best. </p>

<p><em>Recommended Image Size:</em> <strong>??? px x 600 px</strong></p>

<figure>
<img src="assets/cards_graphic.png" alt="Call to Action and Factoid Card" title="Call to Action and Factoid Cards" />
<figcaption>Call to Action and Factoid Card</figcaption>
</figure>

<h4>Teasers</h4>

<p>These are the specs for all teaser types: feature, intro, blocks.</p>

<p><em>Recommended Image Size:</em> <strong>1800 px x 1000 px</strong><br/>
<em>Recommended Image Ratio:</em> <strong>16:9</strong> </p>

<figcaption>Feature Teaser</figcaption>
</figure>

<hr />

<h4>General Images</h4>

<p>When using an image on its own (i.e. not in a teaser or card) on a page or other content type, follow these specifications. Note that images can be entered as full-width, full-width with parallax effect or content width. </p>

<p><em>Recommended Image Size:</em> <strong>3840 px x 2160 px</strong><br/>
<em>Recommended Image Ratio:</em> <strong>16:9</strong> </p>

<figure>

<h3>Rich Text / Body Copy</h3>

<p>There isn’t a limit to the number of words you can use for rich text or other text that would be considered “body copy” for things like bios, articles, etc.</p>

<p>However, keep in mind that online readers scan more than read. This means that breaking text into chunks with headings will greatly help your audience find relevant information. Also, keep sentences short (20 to 25 words) and don’t be afraid to use single-sentence paragraphs. Newspapers are filled with them.</p>

<h2 id="section-advancedtopics">Advanced Topics</h2>

<p>The following sections cover tasks and functionality that not all site users have access to. If you are interested in doing one of these tasks and do not have access to do so on the site, contact a site administrator.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="section-managingmenus">Menus</h3>

<p>To manage the site’s menus, go to Structure &gt; Menus. </p>

<p>The items that will display will vary based on your role on the site, e.g., Admin, Editor, Author.</p>

<h3 id="section-buildingwebforms">Webforms: Building and Managing</h3>

<p>The site uses the YAML webform module which comes with template-style forms for a variety of common form types, e.g., registration. These templates can be used as a starting point to create custom forms.</p>

<h4>Building Forms</h4>

<p>To customize a form:</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to Structure &gt; YAML form</li>
<li>Find the form template you want to use as a base and select Duplicate from the edit options.</li>
<li>Give the new form a title and description.</li>
<li>Customize the form by editing or deleting fields and adding new elements/fields.</li>
<li>Click Save elements to save the form. The form will now be available when using the Webform content type.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>TIPS</strong>
To edit the confirmation message people see when they submit a form (a recommended step), go to the Settings tab of the form and edit the text in the confirmation settings box.<br/>
To see the types of fields/elements you can use, view the example forms.
The module supports emailing people who submit a form and other more advanced functionality. Learn more about <a href="http://yamlform.io/features/">YAML form features</a>. </p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Managing Submissions</h4>

<p>To view, download or take other actions related to form submissions, go to the Results tab of a form.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="section-eventmanagement">Event Management</h3>

<p>The site uses the RNG module for managing event registration. <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/rng">Learn more about the module</a> </p>

<hr />

<h3 id="section-taxonomies">Taxonomies</h3>

<p>Taxonomies are used to manage things like the categories that programs can be filed under and that appear in the program finder. They are also used to manage categories for other types of content, such as articles and event types.</p>

<p>Taxonomies are also used to manage who can edit certain content on the site. The editorial sections taxonomy is one example.</p>

<p>To manage taxonomies, go to Structure &gt; Taxonomy</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>TIP</strong>
If you want change the name of a term that is already used to categorize content, edit the term rather than delete and add a new term. This way you don’t have to retag the content with the updated term name.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h3 id="section-editorialaccess">Editorial Access and Workflows</h3>

<p>To control specific content (e.g. a particular page or program) a CMS user can edit, the site uses a module called Workbench and taxonomies. </p>

<p>The primary taxonomy that’s used to manage editing access to content is the Editorial Sections taxonomy. That taxonomy allows for the creation of groups such as Marketing or Admissions. CMS users are assigned to the various editorial sections created.</p>

<p>Certain content, such as pages, includes an editorial sections tab. In that tab you can select an editorial section. Users who are part of that editorial section can then edit the content, even if they did not originally create it. </p>

<p>An example:
The undergraduate academics page is tagged with the Marketing and Communications editorial section. Jane is a member of the Marketing and Communications editorial section. Jane can edit the undergraduate academics page even though she isn’t the original author.</p>

<p>To manage the editorial section taxonomy, go to Structure &gt; Taxonomy</p>

<p>To manage Workbench, go to Configuration &gt; Workflow</p>

<h4>Workbench</h4>

<p>The <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2121239">Workbench</a> module manages publishing workflows and revisions. </p>

<p>Workbench can be configured to suit North Central’s editorial needs. Some examples:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When an admin creates a new page they can save and publish it immediately
When an editor creates a page and saves it, it is saved as a draft for review by an author who publishes it
When an editor wants to edit an existing page they create a new draft, save it, and an author publishes it or sends it back as a draft</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To configure Workbench settings, go to Configuration &gt; Workflow</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="section-rolesandpermissions">Roles and Permissions</h3>

<p>To control actions CMS users can take and the parts of the CMS they have access to, the site uses roles and permissions. </p>

<p>A “role” is a type of user, e.g., administrator, author, editor. A “permission” is a task that can be completed, e.g., publish a program, delete a page. </p>

<p>Users are allowed to perform tasks based on the role they are assigned. Roles can be assigned manually by administrators and automatically through the North Central College data source used to authenticate users. Roles and permissions can be expanded and modified as needed. </p>

<p>To manage roles, go to People &gt; Roles</p>

<p>To manage permissions, go to People &gt; Permissions</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="section-metatags">Meta Tags/SEO</h3>

<p>To include information like page descriptions that search engines use to match users’ search queries with web content, the site uses the Meta Tags module.</p>

<p>To add a page description to a page or other piece of content, open the Meta Tags box (it will be on the right-hand side of the page if you’re on a desktop computer). Then enter the description.</p>

<p>You can also manage what’s shown when site content is shared on social networks like Facebook using the Meta Tags module.</p>

<p>The Meta Tags module includes many more ways to optimize content for search engines and social networks. Learn more about the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/metatag">Meta Tags module</a>.</p>
