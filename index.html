<h2 id="section-whatisdrupal">What is Drupal? CMS Essentials</h2>

<p>North Central College’s website is built with a content management system – or CMS – called Drupal.</p>

<p>CMSs like Drupal make it possible for people without technical skills to create and edit pages, news articles, events and other content.</p>

<p>If you’ve edited pages on North Central’s old site or used blogging platforms like Wordpress, you’ve used a CMS before. In fact, North Central’s previous site was built with an earlier version of Drupal.</p>

<p>Drupal is an open source product. A strong, dedicated community of developers from around the world contributes the code that makes Drupal run. There’s no cost to use it, and it is the platform of choice for organizations ranging from The Economist to The City of Austin to Cisco to other colleges and universities. </p>

<hr />

<h3>Key Concepts</h3>

<hr />

<h4>Content Types</h4>

<p>Often, when we’re on websites, everything seems like it’s just a page. But in Drupal, there are many different things that create a site. They’re called “content types.”</p>

<p>Content types are like containers that hold elements together.</p>

<p>For example, the elements of an article include a title, an image, a subtitle and body copy.</p>

<p><img src="assets/content_type.png" alt="Content Types" />
North Central’s site includes custom content types like program created for the College’s academic degrees.</p>

<h5>TIP</h5>

<ul>
<li>To see all content types that you have access to create, go to Workbench &gt; Create Content</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4>Nodes</h4>

<p>Every piece of content on the site (a page, a video, a program, etc.) is called a node. When you’re editing the site, you’ll see the unique node ID in the browser’s URL bar. Something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>http://northcentralcollege.edu/node/116/edit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Site visitors never see this unique ID. Instead, they see standard URLs like:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>http://northcentralcollege.edu/how-to-apply</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h4>Templates</h4>

<p>Templates pull all the elements of a content type into a visual look. They’re what visitors see when they come to the site. North Central templates are designed to be highly flexible. </p>

<hr />

<h2 id="section-components">Components: The Site&#8217;s Visual Building Blocks</h2>

<p>Components are the visual building blocks of the site’s templates. When you create content (e.g. page, program), you are given a variety of components to use. The available components and the way you can arrange them have been carefully thought out to balance flexibility with visual consistency across the site.</p>

<p>The site uses the components listed below most frequently. They are the most important to be familiar with, especially if you manage pages: </p>

<hr />

<h4>Cards</h4>

<p><img src="assets/cards.png" alt="Sample of Card Types" />
Cards are interactive blocks that highlight key pieces of information. For example, a profile card features a person’s name, title and their photo. Most cards are intended to guide users to additional information or to take an action. When a user clicks on an event card, for instance, it will take them to the full details of the event. </p>

<p><img src="assets/card_article.png" alt="Article Card" /></p>

<h5>Article</h5>

<p>These are auto-generated by the site to show the basic details of a news article.</p>

<p><img src="assets/card_cta.png" alt="Call to Action Card" /></p>

<h5>Call to Action</h5>

<p>Draw attention and guide users to other content with this card. Text on a call-to-action card should include descriptive or “marketing-style” language rather than just the name of where clicking the card will take the user.</p>

<p><img src="assets/card_cta_photo.png" alt="Call to Action Card with Image" /></p>

<h5>Call to Action with Image</h5>

<p>Similar to the call-to-action card but includes an image.</p>

<p><img src="assets/card_career.png" alt="Career Card" /></p>

<h5>Career</h5>

<p>Use within the program content type to feature a profession that graduates of that program might enter. Include a short description or interesting fact.</p>

<p><img src="assets/card_event.png" alt="Event Card" /></p>

<h5>Event</h5>

<p>These are auto-generated by the site to show the basic details of an event. </p>

<p><img src="http://placehold.it/1280x800" alt="Facebook Card" /></p>

<h5>Facebook</h5>

<p>A post from a North Central Facebook account. These appear in social stacks.</p>

<p><img src="assets/card_factoid.png" alt="Factoid Card" /></p>

<h5>Factoid</h5>

<p>Use this card to highlight a key fact about the College, a program or another topic relevant to where you’re placing the factoid card.</p>

<p><img src="assets/card_feature.png" alt="Feature Card" /></p>

<h5>Feature</h5>

<p>Use the feature card to promote a story or article with “evergreen” appeal. Examples are stories about an alum or a student that aren’t time-sensitive.</p>

<p><img src="assets/card_gallery.png" alt="Gallery Card" /></p>

<h5>Gallery</h5>

<p>Opens a gallery of photos. </p>

<p><img src="http://placehold.it/1280x800" alt="Instagram Card" /></p>

<h5>Instagram</h5>

<p>A post from a North Central Instagram account. These appear in social stacks.</p>

<p><img src="assets/card_image.png" alt="Image Card" /></p>

<h5>Image</h5>

<p>Image cards are good for giving visual relief to stacks with several text-based cards. They feature an image and do not link anywhere.</p>

<p><img src="http://placehold.it/1280x800" alt="Map Card" /></p>

<h5>Map</h5>

<p>Shows the location of an event in a Google map.</p>

<p><img src="http://placehold.it/1280x800" alt="Profile Full Card" /></p>

<h5>Profile - Full</h5>

<p>An image and title of a member of North Central that links to the person’s profile. Typically used to highlight faculty or staff.</p>

<p><img src="http://placehold.it/1280x800" alt="Profile Story Card" /></p>

<h5>Profile - Story</h5>

<p>An image and major or tile of a member of North Central that opens a prose-style profile (e.g. student story). These are typically used to highlight students.</p>

<p><img src="assets/card_program.png" alt="Program Card" /></p>

<h5>Program</h5>

<p>These are mostly auto-generated in places like the program finder to provide a short description of an academic or experiential program that appeals to prospective students.</p>

<p><img src="assets/card_quote.png" alt="Quotes Card" /></p>

<h5>Quote</h5>

<p>A brief quote by a student, professor, or other College community member.</p>

<p><img src="assets/card_title.png" alt="Title Card" /></p>

<h5>Title</h5>

<p>A brief, catchy statement or interesting sentence, similar to a headline or pull quote meant to draw user’s attention but not lead them to click through to other content. The title card doesn’t include a link.</p>

<p><img src="http://placehold.it/1280x800" alt="Twitter Card" /></p>

<h5>Twitter</h5>

<p>A tweet from a North Central Twitter account. These appear in social stacks.</p>

<p><img src="assets/card_video.png" alt="Video Card" /></p>

<h5>Video</h5>

<p>Use this to embed a video in a stack.</p>

<hr />

<h4>Stacks</h4>

<p><img src="assets/stacks.png" alt="Sample of Card Types" />
Stacks are groupings of cards that open and close as a user interacts with them. If a user is on a desktop computer, for example, the stack will animate when the user clicks a card in the stack. If they are on a smartphone or tablet the stack will animate when they touch a card. </p>

<p>There are several types of stacks. For example, group, program and highlight. Each includes different types of cards. We’ve selected which stack types to use on each content type. All you need to do is choose places where you want to use stacks and the cards and content that will be included.</p>

<h5>TIPS</h5>

<ul>
<li>If there’s important information you want users to see in a stack, set the card that contains that information to be a featured card.</li>
<li>Use a variety of card types when creating a stack.</li>
<li>By design, most stack types allow for five cards. While there isn’t a minimum required, aim for at least 3 cards.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4>Teasers</h4>

<p><img src="assets/teasers.png" alt="Sampling of Teasers" />
Teasers are groupings of design elements that typically include an image or video, title, subtitle and text. Some also include a call-to-action button. </p>

<p>There are several types of teasers and you can use them in a variety of combinations. For example, a feature teaser above 4 teaser blocks.</p>

<h5>TIP</h5>

<ul>
<li>Use teasers to organize page content into easy to scan areas rather than walls of text.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="assets/teaser_intro.png" alt="Intro Teaser" /></p>

<h5>Intro Teaser</h5>

<p>Includes a title, subtitle, and area for intro text. CTA buttons can be included as well. Use for introducing a page or section on a page. Combines well with the rich text component.</p>

<p><img src="assets/teaser_feature2.png" alt="Feature Teaser" /></p>

<h5>Feature Teaser</h5>

<p>Includes a title, subtitle, area for text, and spot for media (image, video or gallery). CTA buttons can be included as well. Works well as a stand-alone feature on a page to highlight a topic with media.</p>

<p><img src="assets/teaser_block.png" alt="Teasers Block" /></p>

<h5>Teasers Block</h5>

<p>Allows for up to 4 blocks that each include a title, short description, image and CTA. Use it to summarize a topic and lead users to more information with the CTA. </p>

<hr />

<h4>Calls to Action / CTAs</h4>

<p>Call-to-actions are available throughout the site in a similar way as buttons on the old North Central site.</p>

<p>There are two types:
* CTA buttons on headers and teasers
* CTA cards</p>

<h5>TIPS</h5>

<ul>
<li>Use CTAs for the most important thing you want users to do next or learn more about.</li>
<li>CTAs should guide users to tasks or information in context of the content they appear. For example, on a program page Apply would be a likely action users would want to take.</li>
<li>Do not overuse CTAs on a page or other content. If there are too many, they won&#8217;t do their job of standing out.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4>Rich Text</h4>

<p><img src="assets/rich_text_front.png" alt="Rich Text" />
Rich text is useful when you need to present longer passages of text. It could also be described as “body copy.” The rich text component allows formatting such as heading styles to give your text hierarchy, making it easier for readers to follow. Bulleted lists, italics and bolding are also available. You can also create links to other pages (a.k.a. crosslinks), external sites or documents like PDFs uploaded to a page.</p>

<h5>TIPS</h5>

<ul>
<li>Use heading styles to structure your text. See below for reasons why and how to.</li>
<li>Be purposeful in using formatting tools such as bold and italics. They should add meaning rather than decoration.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Heading Styles</h5>

<p><img src="assets/rich_text_header.png" alt="annotated image of page with heading styles" />
When entering content into the rich text component you need to use heading styles to format headings and subheadings for sections and paragraphs. Heading styles adjust the font of headings and subheadings automatically so they are consistent throughout the site. </p>

<p>IMPORTANT: Do not use bold for headings and subheadings. Only use bold for emphasizing words or phrases in a sentence.</p>

<p>Headings are necessary because they: </p>

<ul>
<li>Give hierarchical structure and order to your information, making it more useful to users.</li>
<li>Are essential for accessibility; visitors using a screen reader need headings to understand the order of information.</li>
<li>Are important for SEO (search engine optimization).</li>
</ul>

<h5>How to Add Headings</h5>

<ol>
<li>Highlight the text you want to make a heading.</li>
<li>Click the Format button and select the heading style you want to use. Note: The title of the page is a Heading 1 so you will want to use a Heading 2, 3 or 4 depending on if there is an intro teaser or other heading in another component already on the page. Be consistent with your heading styles across pages in a section of the site or tabs on content types like programs and departments.</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h4>Tables</h4>

<p><img src="assets/table.png" alt="table example" />
The table component is for adding tabular data to a page. Please note that the table should only be used for numerical-type information and not for organizing paragraphs. In other words, use tables for structured information that is primarily numbers; do not use it for primarily prose that could be presented with normal text.</p>

<h5>EXAMPLES</h5>

<ul>
<li>Do: use a table to show the tuition for degree programs for the upcoming academic year.</li>
<li>Don’t: use tables to list descriptions of different types of programs or organizations.</li>
</ul>

<h5>How to Add a Table</h5>

<p>It’s a good idea to put your table in context with a title and any explanatory copy that will help users understand it. You can do that with the rich text component or an intro teaser. Once you have added that text with the rich text or intro teaser:</p>

<ol>
<li>Choose Table from the dropdown for Add to Section.</li>
<li>Enter the number of rows and columns you’ll need. You can adjust this if you need to.</li>
<li>Enter the data into the table.</li>
</ol>

<h5>TIPS</h5>

<ul>
<li>Use the rich text component (or an intro teaser) for any explanatory copy related to the table.</li>
<li>If you use column headers, make sure to have them on each column so the table displays properly on mobile.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t use footnotes in the table or descriptive copy about the data. That info should be in the rich text or other component.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4>Billboards</h4>

<p>Billboards are built into the top area of certain content types, such as pages and events. So unlike other components, you won’t need to add billboards manually. Billboards typically display a header image, page title and call-to-action buttons. </p>

<figure>
<img src="assets/billboard_general.png" alt="General Billboard" />
<figcaption>General Billboard</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<img src="assets/billboard_media.png" alt="Media Billboard" />
<figcaption>Media Billboard</figcaption>
</figure>

<hr />

<h4>Slider</h4>

<p>The slider component is reserved for the homepage and subsite templates. You can use it to create “slides” of featured news and other content.
<img src="assets/slider.png" alt="Slider" /></p>

<h5>TIP</h5>

<ul>
<li>To increase the chance that a user will see a particular piece of content, put it as the first slide. Not all users will scroll through the slides, so important information should not be placed in slides 2, 3, etc.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="section-imagespecs">Image Specifications</h2>

<hr />

<p>Minimal preparation is required when uploading images. For example, cropping is not necessary. </p>

<p>The site will automatically crop the image to fit the design and the screen size the user is visiting the site on. To ensure that auto cropping doesn’t cut off an important part of an image, you can select a focal point when uploading the image. The focal point won’t be cut off it an image needs to be cropped for viewing on smaller screens.</p>

</ol>

<hr />

<h3 id="section-buildingwebforms">Webforms: Building and Managing</h3>

<p>Depending on your access level on the site you can select pre-built form templates to add to an area of the site. Or you will have the ability to build a form template.</p>

<h4>Create a Form from a Template</h4>

<p>Follow these <a href="#section-generalsteps">general steps</a> to begin the form-creation process. Then follow these instructions and tips:</p>

<h5>Provide Context</h5>

<p>Use the Header &gt; Overview section to include a sentence or two introduction about what the form is for. In a friendly manner, include any special instructions or important information the person completing the form should know.</p>

<h5>Selecting the Form Template</h5>

<p>In the form tab begin entering the name of the form you want to use. </p>

<h4>Build a Custom Form Template</h4>

<p>The site uses the YAML webform module which comes with template-style forms for a variety of common form types, e.g., registration. These templates can be used as a starting point to create custom forms. If you need to create a custom form and have access to the Structure &gt; YAML Forms section of the CMS, follow the instructions below. If you do not have access to that section, contact a site administrator.</p>

<p>To customize a form:</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to Structure or Shortcut &gt; YAML form</li>
<li>Find the form template you want to use as a base and select Duplicate from the edit options.</li>
<li>Give the new form a title and description.</li>
<li>Customize the form by editing or deleting fields and adding new elements/fields.</li>
<li>Click Save elements to save the form. The form will now be available when using the Webform content type.</li>
</ol>

<h5>TIPS</h5>

<ul>
<li>To edit the confirmation message people see when they submit a form (a recommended step), go to the Settings tab of the form and edit the text in the confirmation settings box.</li>
<li>To see the types of fields/elements you can use, view the example forms.</li>
<li>The module supports emailing people who submit a form and other more advanced functionality. Learn more about <a href="http://yamlform.io/features/">YAML form features</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Managing Submissions</h4>

<p>To view, download or take other actions related to form submissions, go to the Results tab of a form.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="section-eventmanagement">Event Management</h3>

<p>The site uses the RNG module for managing event registration. <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/rng">Learn more about the module</a> </p>

<hr />

<h3 id="section-taxonomies">Taxonomies</h3>

<p>Taxonomies are used to manage things like the categories that programs can be filed under and that appear in the program finder. They are also used to manage categories for other types of content, such as articles and event types.</p>

<p>Taxonomies are also used to manage who can edit certain content on the site. The editorial sections taxonomy is one example.</p>

<p>To manage taxonomies, go to Structure &gt; Taxonomy</p>

<h5>TIP</h5>

<ul>
<li>If you want change the name of a term that is already used to categorize content, edit the term rather than delete and add a new term. This way you don’t have to retag the content with the updated term name.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="section-editorialaccess">Editorial Access and Workflows</h3>

<p>To control specific content (e.g. a particular page or program) a CMS user can edit, the site uses a module called Workbench and taxonomies. </p>

<p>The primary taxonomy that’s used to manage editing access to content is the Editorial Sections taxonomy. That taxonomy allows for the creation of groups such as Marketing or Admissions. CMS users are assigned to the various editorial sections created.</p>

<p>Certain content, such as pages, includes an editorial sections tab. In that tab you can select an editorial section. Users who are part of that editorial section can then edit the content, even if they did not originally create it. </p>

<p>An example:
The undergraduate academics page is tagged with the Marketing and Communications editorial section. Jane is a member of the Marketing and Communications editorial section. Jane can edit the undergraduate academics page even though she isn’t the original author.</p>

<p>To manage the editorial section taxonomy, go to Structure &gt; Taxonomy</p>

<p>To manage Workbench, go to Configuration &gt; Workflow</p>

<h4>Workbench</h4>

<p>The <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2121239">Workbench</a> module manages publishing workflows and revisions. </p>

<p>Workbench can be configured to suit North Central’s editorial needs. Some examples:
* When an admin creates a new page they can save and publish it immediately.
* When an editor creates a page and saves it, it is saved as a draft for review by an author who publishes it.
* When an editor wants to edit an existing page they create a new draft, save it, and an author publishes it or sends it back as a draft.</p>

<p>To configure Workbench settings, go to Configuration &gt; Workflow</p>

<h3 id="section-rolesandpermissions">Roles and Permissions</h3>

<p>To control actions CMS users can take and the parts of the CMS they have access to, the site uses roles and permissions. </p>

<p>A “role” is a type of user, e.g., administrator, author, editor. A “permission” is a task that can be completed, e.g., publish a program, delete a page. </p>

<p>Users are allowed to perform tasks based on the role they are assigned. Roles can be assigned manually by administrators and automatically through the North Central College data source used to authenticate users. Roles and permissions can be expanded and modified as needed. </p>

<p>To manage roles, go to People &gt; Roles</p>

<p>To manage permissions, go to People &gt; Permissions</p>

<h3 id="section-metatags">Meta Tags/SEO</h3>
